# PWA Text Editor

## Description

The purpose of this project was to develop a text editor app that can run in the browser and additionally can run offline.  By running this application I can see that the JavaScript files have been bundled using webpack and when I run the webpack plugins I can now see that I generated HTML, service worker, and a manifest file. In this project I learned how to use webpack plugins and I learned how to use the service worker to make the application both functional online as well as offline.   

## Installation

In order to start the application you first need to run and npm install.  After this command installs the correct packages then by running npm start, the application can now be opened in the port requested in the given code.  Through the deployed webapage,  https://pwa-text-editor-cgjr.onrender.com/  the install button will now be functional which will then allow to run the text editor both online and offline.
